## Description of Game ##

21 is a two player game-- the player and the dealer
2 cards each are dealt
1 card is face-down, visible only to each player; the other is face-up

The cards are totaled:
  Number cards are evaluated as expected
  Face cards evaluate as 10
  An Ace can be high (11) or low (1), depending on which is more advantageous

The player hits until they are sufficiently close to (but not over) 21
If they are over 21, they "bust" and the dealer wins by default
The dealer follows the player, hitting until they are sufficiently close to 21
If neither player nor dealer busts, whoever is closer to 21 at the end of the round wins.
In the event of a tie, the dealer wins
